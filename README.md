# ALAMWorkshops
So this is the ALAM 2025-2026 cohort hosted by Edgar, an aspiring Embedded Systems/ Systems Engineer at the time writing this. I decided to tailor this Github rundown of knowledge that could help both my current team as well as future cohorts who join as ISAM sub-contractors. 

What this Workshop will cover:
* Git Tag
* Git Branch
* Practices to avoid Merge conflicts 

## Git Tag
Simply put, its pretty much a bookmark of all of your final code for whatever you plan to use it for. Say you made a program to make an automated coffee machine and you've made sure it works 100%. You can git tag it to bring the code contents you had that made it work that 100%. So I'll research and walk through how to make a git tag using one of my old homeworks which I have modified(not plagerizing).

``` bash
git tag
```
